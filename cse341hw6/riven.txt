I made four main changes
1. I changed the tetris pieces to five new shapes
2. Instead of the colors being random, each shape has a distinct color associated with it
3. I changed the scoring system to be in base 25
2. I disabled the 'cheat' option

These aren't very significant deviations from the original game, so I don't expect to get a lot/any extra credit,
however I figured I might as well submit this version as well. If you're a fan of the video game Riven, you might
get the reference and think these changes are pretty cool. Otherwise, you will probably be confused as to why I
bothered making these changes
