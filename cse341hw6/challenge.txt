For the challenge problem, I made four main changes:

1. I changed the tetris pieces to five new shapes
2. Instead of the colors being random, each shape has a distinct color associated with it
3. I changed the scoring system to be in base 25
4. I disabled the 'cheat' option

These aren't very significant deviations, so I don't expect to get a lot/any extra credit, however I figured I 
might as well submit it, since I made it. If you're a fan of the video game Riven, you might get the reference and
think this new version is pretty cool. Otherwise, you will probably be confused as to why I bothered at all.
